.SH NAME
tre \- tree, improved.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tre
[path] [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Display file system content in tree diagram.
.sp
Hidden files and those configured to be ignored by \fBgit\fR will be
(optionally) ignored.
.sp
With correct configuration, each displayed file can have a shell alias created
for it, which opens the file in the default editor or an otherwise specified
command.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Print all files and directories, including hidden ones.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-directories\fR
Only list directories in output.

.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-json\fR
Output JSON instead of tree diagram.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-editor\fR [\fIEDITOR\fR]
Create aliases for each displayed result in /tmp/tre_aliases_$USER and add
a number in front of file name to indicate the alias name. For example, a number
"42" means an shell alias "e42" has been created. Running "e42" will cause the
associated file or directory to be open with $EDITOR, or a command specified
along with this command.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-simple\fR
Use normal print despite gitignore settings. '-a' has higher priority.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show version number.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
