# main

- Add M1 builds to release.
- Support installing from Nix flake.

# 0.3.6

- Fixed a bug when root isn't ".", the paths for sub-directories are wrong.

# 0.3.5

- Fix a bug where intermediary directories from `git ls-files` don't have
  correct path, resulting in wrong colors in output, as well as non-functioning
  editor alias.

# 0.3.4

- Add '--limit/-l' option, which limits the maximum diplay depth of the file
  tree.

# 0.3.3

- Hidden directory as the direct input now reveals its content. Previously the
  input directory is not exempt from the "hiding the hidden directry"
  functionality unless `-a` is used. Implemented by [JaSpa][] at #55.

  the executable now.

# 0.3.0

Added editor/program aliasing support for Command Prompt and PowerShell on
Windows.

# 0.2.3

# 0.2.2

Improve stability. Reduce possibility of crashing.

# 0.2.1

Add initial Windows build.

# 0.2.0

**Breaking change**: The `-e` option now takes an optional argument. When the
argument is supplied, it'll be used as the command instead of the `$EDITOR`
environment variable for opening the selected path. In previous setup
instructions, the invocation in shell scripts is `tre -e PATH`. In this release,
that command will cause `tre` to think `PATH` is the editor argument. So user
will need to update their setup to be `tre PATH -e` instead (README has been
updated to reflect this.)

This release is rewritten from scratch in Rust, which brings some nice speed up
and Linux binary distribution. In the near futrue, Windows PowerShell support
could be added as well.
