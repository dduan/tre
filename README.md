# tre

A replacement for `tree` command that uses `git ls-files` as source of file when
possible.

_tre_ can also create shell aliases that, when executed, opens the file
associated with it with the default editor. Here's that function in action:

![Aliasing In Action](alias_demo.gif)

… in case you missed it: "22" is listed in front of "README.md" and typing "e22"
opened the file! See [how to set this up](#editor-aliasing).

Runs on Unix as well as Windows PowerShell.

## Install

### Homebrew or Linuxbrew

```
brew install dduan/formulae/tre
```

### Windows (Scoop)

```
scoop bucket add dduan https://github.com/dduan/scoop-bucket
scoop install tre
```

### [Snap](https://snapcraft.io)

```
snap install --devmode --beta tre
```

## Editor aliasing

*This feature doesn't work on Windows yet.*

### Setting it up

tre provides a `-e` flag that, when used, turns on the "editor aliasing"
feature. Some shell configuration will make this work better.

By default, the environment variable `$EDITOR` is used as the editor. If a value
following `-e` is supplied (`tre -e emacs` instead of `tre -e`), then the
command specified by this value will be used instead of `$EDITOR`.

#### Bash or Zsh

In `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` (for example)

```bash
tre() { command tre "$@" -e && source "/tmp/tre_aliases_$USER" 2>/dev/null; }
```

#### Fish

Create `~/.config/fish/functions/tre.fish`:

```fish
function tre
  command tre $argv -e; and source /tmp/tre_aliases_$USER ^/dev/null
end
```


### How it works

The first thing you'll notice is some numbers in front of each file name in
tre's output. If pick a number, say, "3", and enter `e3` in the shell, the file
after "3" will open in your default editor (specified by the environment
variable `EDITOR`).

Everytime tre runs with `-e`, it updates a file `/tmp/tre_aliases_$USER`
and adds a alias for each result it displays. And the shell configuration simply
sources this file after the command. You can manually run

```bash
source /tmp/tre_aliases_$USER
```

… instead of configuring your shell (if you are _that_ patient!).

This feature is inspired by [tag](https://github.com/keith/tag).

## Help

```
Usage: tre [path] [option]

Print files, directories, and symlinks in tree form.

Hidden files and those configured to be ignored by git will be (optionally)
ignored.

With correct configuration, each displayed file can have a shell alias created
for it, which opens the file in the default editor or an otherwise specified
command.

Path:
    The root path whose content is to be listed. Defaults to ".".

Options:
    -a, --all           Print all files and directories, including hidden
                        ones.
    -s, --simple        Use normal print despite gitignore settings. '-a' has
                        higher priority.
    -e, --editor [EDITOR]
                        Create aliases for each displayed result in
                        /tmp/tre_aliases_$USER and add a number in front of
                        file name to indicate the alias name. For example, a
                        number "42" means an shell alias "e42" has been
                        created. Running "e42" will cause the associated file
                        or directory to be open with $EDITOR, or a command
                        specified along with this command.
    -v, --version       Show version number.
    -h, --help          Show this help message.
